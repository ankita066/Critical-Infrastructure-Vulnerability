# Critical-Infrastructure-Vulnerability
We aim to create a model which can classify power plantâ€™s vulnerability across the US. Using this model, disaster management plans and teams would be able to better handle the effects of high wind speeds. The model uses monthly wind and precipitation data from NASA GES DISC and the power plants location data from Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD).
